      <p>
        I am transitioning from 10 years working in the retail field to persue
        my life long passion of becoming a software/web developer. Having spent
        a lot of my youth working on game development projects, and other
        programming related tasks, I have always loved solving problems through
        code and seeing those solutions appear on screen.
